# Implementation Progress

Last updated: 2025-10-18

## Phase 1: Setup
- [X] Complete (20/20 tasks)

## Phase 2: Foundational (Domain Layer + Port Interfaces)
- [X] Complete (52/52 tasks)

## Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1) - Domain Stability
- [X] Complete (34/34 tasks)
- Notes:
  - Domain packages verified via `go test ./internal/domain/...` after CLI adjustments
  - `go test ./tests -run TestIntegration` confirms pipeline execution remains intact
  - Added `--non-interactive` flag to `streamy apply` without touching domain code
  - Full `go test ./...` run passes (includes integration suite)

## Phase 4: User Story 2 (P1) - Plugin Swappability
- [X] Complete (29/29 tasks)
- Notes:
  - New registry now performs dependency validation/cycle detection and exposes `GetForDependent`, covered by unit tests (`internal/infrastructure/plugin/registry_test.go`)
  - Symlink plugin now implements the new `ports.Plugin` contract (`internal/plugins/symlink/`), aided by shared conversion helpers in `internal/plugins/portutil/`
  - Package plugin now has a ports-native adapter (`internal/plugins/package/port_plugin.go`) reusing shared conversion helpers
  - Added deterministic `TestExecutor` and an executor swap integration test to prove port-based adapters produce identical results after normalising runtime-only fields
  - Validated plugin dependency flow and strangler parity via `go test ./tests -run TestPluginDependency` and full `go test ./...` (SC-007) runs

## Phase 5: User Story 3 (P2) - Unified Observability
- [ ] In Progress (22/30 tasks complete)
- Notes:
  - CLI now seeds correlation IDs at startup, threads them through Cobra command contexts, and records the value on initial startup logs
  - Main wiring shares the charmbracelet/log adapter across use cases and infrastructure adapters, ensuring correlated logs from loaders, executor, and validation service
  - Registry and dashboard commands now emit structured logs (start, success, error) while preserving human-readable stdout/stderr output, enabling traceability of CLI-driven workflows
  - Legacy `internal/logger` shim now delegates to the charmbracelet adapter, removing the zerolog dependency while keeping backwards-compatible APIs for strangler paths
  - Application use cases publish structured domain events (pipeline/validation lifecycle), wired to a charmbracelet-backed event publisher for unified observability hooks
  - Execution engine now emits step lifecycle events (started/completed/failed) with per-step metadata, allowing downstream subscribers to track execution progress without parsing stdout
  - Added CLI observability harness (`cmd/streamy/observability_test.go`) that runs `streamy verify` end-to-end, capturing structured logs + events to ensure correlation IDs and layer metadata appear in every entry

## Phase 6: User Story 4 (P2) - Isolated Testing

- [ ] Not started (0/21 tasks complete)

## Phase 8: User Story 6 (P3) - Structured Errors
- [ ] Not started (0/20 tasks complete)

## Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] Not started (0/50 tasks complete)
