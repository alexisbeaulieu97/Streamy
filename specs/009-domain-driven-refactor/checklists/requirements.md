# Specification Quality Checklist: Domain-Driven Architecture Refactor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Code Exploration Findings** (2025-10-15):

Current codebase structure analyzed:
- ✅ Confirmed partial domain/app separation exists (`internal/domain/pipeline`, `internal/app/pipeline`)
- ✅ Identified coupling issues: domain imports `internal/config`, `internal/engine`, `internal/logger`, `internal/plugin`
- ✅ Verified logger currently uses `zerolog` not `charmbracelet/log` (migration needed)
- ✅ Confirmed context propagation exists but not fully leveraged (ExecutionContext has context.Context field)
- ✅ Validated some DI exists in main.go but domain services still tightly coupled to concrete types
- ✅ Identified mixed concerns in packages (config has YAML + domain entities, plugin has interface + registry)

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on architectural outcomes (testability, maintainability, separation of concerns) rather than specific Go packages or tools
- ✅ While charmbracelet/log is mentioned, it's specified as a technical constraint in the user input, not an implementation detail leaked into the spec
- ✅ User stories describe developer experiences and behaviors, not code structure
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with substantial detail

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking domain entities have no infrastructure imports)
- ✅ Success criteria are quantitative (SC-001: <100ms, SC-002: 90%+ coverage, SC-005: <5s shutdown) and qualitative but measurable (SC-010: validated through documentation review)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details - they describe outcomes ("developers can add step types") not how ("by modifying X file")
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear conditions
- ✅ Edge cases section addresses key boundary conditions with proposed handling approaches
- ✅ Scope is bounded: refactoring existing Streamy functionality into new architecture without changing external behavior (SC-007)
- ✅ Assumptions are documented inline within edge cases (e.g., events can be buffered, domain uses composition)

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ Functional requirements map to user stories (FR-001-006 → US1, FR-007-012 → US2/US4, FR-024-028 → US3/US6)
- ✅ User scenarios are prioritized (P1: core separation, P2: testability/observability, P3: error handling UX)
- ✅ Each priority level is independently testable per the specification requirements
- ✅ Success criteria are directly tied to user stories (SC-001-002 → US4 testability, SC-004-005 → US3/US5 observability, SC-006-007 → US1/US2 stability)

**Overall Assessment**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. All checklist items pass validation.
