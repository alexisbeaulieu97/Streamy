# Specification Quality Checklist: Registry Management CLI Commands

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 9, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED  
**Validated**: October 9, 2025  
**Validator**: AI Agent

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Detailed Findings

**Content Quality**: All user stories focus on user value and business needs without leaking implementation details. Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

**Requirement Completeness**: 20 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. 10 success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts) without referencing technology. 10 edge cases identified with expected behaviors. 10 assumptions documented.

**Feature Readiness**: 5 prioritized user stories (2 P1, 2 P2, 1 P3) cover the complete feature scope with 4 acceptance scenarios each. User stories are independently testable as specified in the template guidelines.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No blockers or open questions remain
