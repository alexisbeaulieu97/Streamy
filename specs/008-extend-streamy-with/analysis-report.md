### 3. Consistency Issues

**✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**

All issues identified in the initial analysis have been fixed:

#### ✅ RESOLVED: M-001 (Concurrent Access Test)
- **Original Issue**: FR-017 required atomic file operations but lacked explicit concurrent access test
- **Resolution**: Added task T066a to `tasks.md` for testing concurrent register/unregister operations
- **Verification**: Task now spawns goroutines to simulate simultaneous operations and validates no data corruption
- **Status**: COMPLETE

#### ✅ RESOLVED: L-001 (Terminology - "refresh" vs "verify")  
- **Original Issue**: Inconsistent use of "refresh command" and "verify operation" terminology
- **Resolution**: 
  - Added comprehensive glossary to `quickstart.md` defining all key terms
  - Updated `data-model.md` sections 4.4 and 4.5 to consistently use "refresh command invokes engine.Verify()"
- **Status**: COMPLETE

#### ✅ RESOLVED: L-002 (Pipeline Identifier Ambiguity)
- **Original Issue**: FR-006 mentioned "ID or name" but contracts only supported ID lookup
- **Resolution**: 
  - Updated `spec.md` FR-006 to clarify "by ID (pipeline identifiers are the primary key)"
  - Added glossary entry in `quickstart.md` clarifying ID vs name semantics
- **Status**: COMPLETE

#### ✅ RESOLVED: L-003 (File Path Reference)
- **Original Issue**: Analysis incorrectly reported path mismatch in plan.md
- **Resolution**: Verified `plan.md` already shows correct path `internal/registry/helpers.go`
- **Status**: FALSE POSITIVE - no fix needed

---

### 4. Ambiguity Detection

**No critical ambiguities found.** All requirements use normative language (MUST), success criteria have measurable targets, and tasks reference specific files/functions.

**Minor clarifications recommended** (already captured in LOW issues above):
- Clarify FR-006 identifier semantics (L-002)
- Clarify "refresh" vs "verify" terminology (L-001)

---

### 5. Underspecification Detection

**No underspecified requirements found.** All user stories have acceptance scenarios, all functional requirements have testable conditions, all tasks reference concrete deliverables.

**Evidence of completeness**:
- 10 edge cases documented in spec.md
- All commands have error cases specified in contracts/
- Test tasks (T008-T011, T019-T022, etc.) created before implementation tasks
- Performance targets quantified (SC-001: <100ms, SC-002: <1s, SC-003: <30s)
- Concurrency model explicit (worker pool with semaphore, default 5 workers)

---

### 6. Duplicate Detection

**No duplicate requirements or tasks found.** Each FR has distinct responsibility, each task has unique deliverable.

**Validated**:
- FR-001 (register command) vs FR-003 (ID generation): Different concerns, FR-003 is subroutine of FR-001
- FR-007 (refresh all) vs FR-008 (refresh one): Same command with optional argument, correctly separated
- T046 (single refresh) vs T047 (worker pool): Different code paths, correctly separated

- **Impact**: Critical FR-017 (atomic operations) now has explicit validation
- **Files Modified**: `specs/008-extend-streamy-with/tasks.md`

### L-001: Terminology Inconsistency ("refresh" vs "verify") ✅ RESOLVED
- **Action Taken**: 
  - Added comprehensive glossary to quickstart.md clarifying all key terms
  - Updated data-model.md section 4.4 to consistently use "refresh command invokes engine.Verify()"
  - Updated section 4.5 concurrent refresh pattern description

  - Updated spec.md FR-006 to clarify unregister accepts ID only (removed "or name")
  - Added clarification to quickstart.md glossary that ID is primary key, name is metadata only
- **Impact**: Removes ambiguity about lookup keys vs descriptive metadata
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `specs/008-extend-streamy-with/spec.md`

## Recommendations

### ✅ All Required Actions Completed

All identified issues have been resolved. The specification is now ready for implementation.

### Implementation Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 1 Implementation** (Setup - Shared Infrastructure):
   - Start with T001-T004: Create `internal/registry/helpers.go` with ID generation and validation
   - These tasks can run in parallel [P] after directory creation
   - Estimated time: 2-4 hours including tests

2. **Continue with Phase 2** (Foundational):
   - T005-T007: Create parent command structure
   - Sequential dependency on Phase 1 completion
   - Estimated time: 1-2 hours

3. **Parallel User Story Implementation** (Phase 3-7):
   - US1 (Register) and US2 (List) can be developed in parallel (both P1 priority)
   - US3 (Unregister) and US4 (Refresh) can follow in parallel (both P2 priority)
   - US5 (Show) is optional (P3 priority), can be deferred

4. **Integration & Validation** (Phase 8):
   - T063-T066a: Integration tests including new concurrent access test
   - T070: Performance validation on Linux (SC-001, SC-002, SC-003)
   - T073: Dashboard integration verification
   - T074: Quickstart validation checklist
