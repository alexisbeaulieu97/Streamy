# Plugin Interface Refactoring Checklist: Unify and Simplify the Plugin System

**Purpose**: Comprehensive PR review gate with breaking change audit for the unified plugin interface refactoring. Validates requirement quality, contract correctness, migration completeness, and rollback safety.

**Created**: October 7, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [plan.md](../plan.md) | [tasks.md](../tasks.md)

**Checklist Type**: Hybrid - Standard PR Review Gate + Breaking Change Audit  
**Depth**: Comprehensive (~45 items covering all critical risk areas)  
**Audience**: PR reviewers, core maintainers

**Note**: This checklist validates the **quality of requirements and design**, not the implementation. Each item tests whether the specifications are complete, clear, consistent, and ready for implementation.
