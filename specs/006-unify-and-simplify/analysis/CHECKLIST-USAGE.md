# Checklist Usage Guide

**Checklist**: `checklists/interface-refactoring.md`  
**Purpose**: Requirements quality validation throughout development lifecycle  
**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025

---

## What is the Checklist?

The `interface-refactoring.md` checklist is a **78-item quality gate** that validates requirements clarity, completeness, and implementation readiness across 12 categories:

1. Interface Contract Correctness (10 items)
2. Read-Only Guarantee (7 items)
3. Executor Integration (9 items)
4. Plugin Migration Completeness (7 items)
5. Performance Requirements (6 items)
6. Exception & Error Flows (7 items)
7. Idempotency & State Management (5 items)
8. Concurrency & Parallel Execution (4 items)
9. Breaking Change Audit & Rollback (7 items)
10. Documentation & Traceability (6 items)
11. Requirement Consistency (5 items)
12. Ambiguities & Missing Definitions (5 items)

---

## When Items Get Checked

### Phase 1: Specification (Items Checked: 50+)
**Timing**: During `/specify` and `/clarify` commands  
**Items**: CHK001-CHK033, CHK034-CHK051, CHK056-CHK078  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** after gap analysis on October 7, 2025

These items validate that **requirements are clear, complete, and ready for implementation**:
- Are interfaces fully defined?
- Are error types specified?
- Are migration phases documented?
- Are ambiguities resolved?

**Result**: 70/78 items (90%) checked after gap analysis remediation.

---

### Phase 2: Implementation (Items To Check: 8)
**Timing**: During task execution (T001-T036)  
**Items**: CHK052-CHK055 (Concurrency)  
**When**: As code is written and concurrency patterns emerge

**Remaining unchecked items** focus on **implementation-level concerns**:
- CHK052: Concurrency safety for parallel Evaluate()
- CHK053: Shared resource access during parallel execution
- CHK054: Parallel Evaluate() + serial Apply() interaction
- CHK055: Race condition scenarios

**Action**: Check these as you implement tasks T011-T015 (Executor refactoring) and observe actual concurrency behavior.

---

### Phase 3: Pre-Merge Validation
**Timing**: Before PR approval  
**Items**: All critical path items (27 items)  
**Who**: PR reviewer

**Critical Path Items** (must all be checked before merge):
- ✅ CHK001-CHK010: Interface contract correctness
- ✅ CHK011-CHK017: Read-only guarantee
- ✅ CHK027-CHK033: Plugin migration completeness
- ✅ CHK056-CHK062: Breaking change audit

**Current Status**: **ALL CRITICAL PATH ITEMS CHECKED** ✅

---

## Current Status

### Completed: Specification Quality ✅

After gap analysis and remediation on October 7, 2025:

```
✅ 70/78 items checked (90%)
✅ All CRITICAL and HIGH severity gaps resolved
✅ All critical path items validated
✅ Implementation-ready
```

**Checked Items Include**:
- All interface contract definitions
- Read-only enforcement mechanism
- Performance measurement methodology  
- Error type specifications
- Migration phase mappings
- Breaking change acknowledgment
- Documentation requirements
- Requirement consistency validation

**What This Means**: The specification phase is **complete and validated**. You can proceed with implementation confidence.

---

### Remaining: Implementation Validation ⏳

**8 items** remain unchecked (10%):
- CHK052-CHK055: Concurrency & parallel execution (4 items)
- 4 implementation-phase items that depend on actual code behavior

**When to Check**: During executor refactoring (tasks T011-T015) when implementing parallel DAG execution.

**Why Not Checked Yet**: These items validate **actual implementation behavior**, not requirements specifications. They become checkable only after code exists.

---

## How to Use the Checklist

### As a Developer (During Implementation)

1. **Reference for Clarity**: When implementing tasks, refer to checked items to understand what was specified
2. **Check Remaining Items**: As you write executor/concurrency code, validate and check CHK052-CHK055
3. **Use as Test Guide**: Contract test requirements (CHK015, CHK030, CHK050) guide what tests to write

### As a Reviewer (During PR Review)

1. **Validate Critical Path**: Ensure all 27 critical path items are checked (currently: ✅ all checked)
2. **Verify Implementation Matches Spec**: Use checklist references to validate code matches requirements
3. **Check Documentation**: Validate CHK063-CHK068 are satisfied by updated documentation

### During Post-Merge Validation

1. **Run Quickstart**: Execute all 12 steps in `quickstart.md` (CHK068)
2. **Verify Benchmarks**: Validate performance within 20% budget (CHK034-CHK039)
3. **Monitor Production**: Check for issues flagged in CHK058-CHK060

---

## Comparison: Before vs. After Gap Analysis

### Before Gap Analysis (All Unchecked)
```
Status: 0/78 items checked (0%)
Issues: 12 findings (1 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH)
Implementation Ready: ❌ NO
```

### After Gap Analysis + Remediation (Now)
```
Status: 70/78 items checked (90%)
Issues: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH (all resolved)
Implementation Ready: ✅ YES
```

**Improvement**: +70 validated items, all blocking issues resolved.

---

## What Changed During Remediation

The gap analysis identified and resolved 6 major issues that allowed us to check off 70 items:

1. **C1 (Constitution)**: Added pre-1.0 exception → CHK056, CHK072 checkable
2. **A1 (Read-Only)**: Added enforcement mechanism → CHK012, CHK013, CHK015-CHK017, CHK074 checkable
3. **A2 (Performance)**: Added measurement methodology → CHK035-CHK039, CHK075 checkable
4. **U1 (Command Plugin)**: Added exception documentation → CHK016, CHK011 clarified
5. **I1 (Consistency)**: Fixed plugin lists → CHK027, CHK028, CHK071 checkable
6. **D1 (Duplication)**: Merged requirements → CHK066 improved

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Specification validated (70 items checked)
- ✅ All critical path items verified
- ✅ Implementation ready

### During Implementation (Phase 3)
- [ ] Check CHK052-CHK055 as concurrency code is written
- [ ] Reference checklist during task execution for guidance
- [ ] Use contract test requirements (T010) to satisfy testability items

### Before PR Merge
- [ ] Verify all 78 items are checked
- [ ] Run quickstart.md validation (12 steps)
- [ ] Validate performance benchmarks within budget

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to check items manually?**  
A: The gap analysis process checked specification items automatically. You'll manually check the 8 remaining implementation items as you write code.

**Q: Can I proceed with implementation with 8 items unchecked?**  
A: Yes! Those 8 items validate implementation behavior, not specifications. The specification is complete.

**Q: What if I discover new gaps during implementation?**  
A: Add new checklist items or update gap-analysis-report.md. Communicate with the team before proceeding.

**Q: How does this relate to the 36 tasks in tasks.md?**  
A: Tasks are **what to implement**. Checklist is **how to validate quality**. Use both together.

**Q: Are all 78 items required before merge?**  
A: All **critical path items** (27) must pass. The other 51 items should pass but may have justified exceptions documented in gap analysis.

## Document References

- **Checklist**: `checklists/interface-refactoring.md`
- **Gap Analysis**: `analysis/gap-analysis-report.md`
- **Remediation Details**: `analysis/remediation-proposals.md`
- **Implementation Certificate**: `analysis/IMPLEMENTATION-READY.md`
- **Tasks**: `tasks.md` (36 ordered tasks)

---

**Bottom Line**: The checklist is **90% complete** after gap analysis. The specification is **validated and implementation-ready**. The remaining 8 items will be checked during code implementation, not before.
