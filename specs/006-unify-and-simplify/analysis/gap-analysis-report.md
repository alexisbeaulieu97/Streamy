# Gap Analysis Report: Unify and Simplify the Plugin System

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Feature**: 006-unify-and-simplify  
**Analyzer**: speckit.analyze workflow  
**Documents Analyzed**: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md, constitution.md

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive cross-artifact analysis identified **12 findings** across specification documents:
- **1 CRITICAL** issue requiring resolution before implementation
- **3 HIGH** severity issues (ambiguities/underspecification)
- **5 MEDIUM** severity issues (inconsistencies/gaps)
- **3 LOW** severity issues (minor improvements)

**Overall Assessment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirements need clarification before Phase 3 implementation**

The specification is well-structured and comprehensive, but contains one critical constitutional violation (C1) and several ambiguities (A1, A2, U1) that could lead to implementation inconsistencies or rework. All issues have concrete remediation proposals ready for approval.

---

## Critical Findings (Blocking)

### C1: Constitution Violation - Plugin API Backward Compatibility

**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Location**: constitution.md:L60-67 vs plan.md:L155-162  
**Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKING IMPLEMENTATION

**Problem**: 
- Constitution Principle III mandates: "Plugin API contracts MUST be backward compatible within major versions"
- Plan explicitly chooses: "Big bang migration with no backward compatibility"
- Direct constitutional violation without documented justification or exception

**Impact**:
- Constitutional authority is compromised if violations aren't resolved
- Future contributors may be confused about when breaking changes are acceptable
- Could set dangerous precedent for ignoring constitutional principles

**Recommendation**: 
Add pre-1.0 exception clause to constitution (see remediation-proposals.md:C1)

**Proposed Exception**:
> "Pre-1.0 Exception: During pre-1.0 development (versions 0.x.y), plugin API breaking changes are permitted without backward compatibility when no external plugin ecosystem exists and all built-in plugins migrate simultaneously"

---

## High Severity Findings (Should Fix Before Implementation)

### A1: Ambiguous Read-Only Enforcement Mechanism

**Severity**: üü† HIGH  
**Location**: spec.md:FR-013, contracts/plugin-interface.md:L52-58, research.md:L33-55

**Problem**:
- FR-013 states Evaluate() "MUST be strictly read-only"
- Contract lists forbidden operations (write files, execute commands, etc.)
- Research acknowledges Go has no language-level enforcement
- No specification of HOW read-only guarantee is verified

**Ambiguities**:
- What exactly constitutes a "mutation"? (temp files? HTTP GET requests?)
- How are violations detected? (manual review? automated tests?)
- What happens when violation is found? (test fails? PR blocked?)

**Risk**:
- Plugin developers may interpret "read-only" differently
- Test implementation may be inconsistent across plugins
- Could discover violations late in implementation, requiring rework

**Recommendation**: 
Add enforcement definition section with concrete test implementation (see remediation-proposals.md:A1)

---

### A2: Unclear Performance Budget Measurement Methodology

**Severity**: üü† HIGH  
**Location**: spec.md:FR-016, tasks.md:T035, research.md:L166-186

**Problem**:
- FR-016 allows "up to 20% overhead" compared to current Check() method
- No specification of:
  - What is the baseline? (which commit? when measured?)
  - What test scenarios? (which files? what sizes?)
  - Per-plugin or aggregate budget?
  - What happens if exceeded? (fail PR? require justification?)

**Risk**:
- Task T035 benchmarking effort may produce inconsistent results
- No clear pass/fail criteria for PR approval
- Could discover performance issues late in implementation

**Recommendation**: 
Add detailed measurement methodology to research.md (see remediation-proposals.md:A2)

---

### U1: Command Plugin Evaluation Contract Ambiguity

**Severity**: üü† HIGH  
**Location**: tasks.md:T028-T031, contracts/plugin-interface.md:L52

**Problem**:
- Command/internalexec plugins execute user-provided commands
- User commands MAY mutate state (cannot be enforced by plugin)
- Fundamental tension with "Evaluate() MUST be read-only" contract
- No guidance on how to handle this special case

**Risk**:
- Implementation may struggle with contract during T028-T031
- Contract tests for command plugin will be unclear
- Documentation may mislead users about read-only guarantee

**Recommendation**: 
Add explicit command plugin exception with best practices (see remediation-proposals.md:U1)

---

## Medium Severity Findings (Recommended Fixes)

### I1: Plugin List Inconsistency

**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Location**: spec.md:FR-015 vs tasks.md phases

**Problem**: FR-015 lists 8 plugins alphabetically but tasks.md groups them into phases (Simple/Medium/Complex/Meta). No explicit mapping.

**Recommendation**: Update FR-015 to show phase groupings (see remediation-proposals.md:I1)

---

### D1: Duplicate Requirements

**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Location**: spec.md:FR-004 and FR-011

**Problem**: Both requirements describe goal of encouraging declarative plugin design through interface simplification.

**Recommendation**: Merge into single enhanced FR-004 (see remediation-proposals.md:D1 - optional)

---

### A3: Blocked State Handling Underspecified

**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Location**: data-model.md:L66-70, contracts/executor-plugin.md:L45-49

**Problem**: 
- VerificationStatus includes "Blocked" state
- No definition of what causes Blocked state
- No guidance for plugins on when to return Blocked vs Failed
- Executor contract shows "‚äò step blocked" log but no handling logic

**Recommendation**: Add "Blocked State Handling" section to executor contract explaining:
- When to use Blocked (dependency failed, required tool missing, etc.)
- How executor handles Blocked (skip? error? continue?)
- Example scenarios

---

### U2: Context Cancellation Behavior Incomplete

**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Location**: spec.md Edge Cases, tasks.md:T014

**Problem**:
- Spec mentions context cancellation handling
- No specification of partial state mutation during Apply()
- Should cancelled Apply() rollback? Leave partial state? Just log error?

**Recommendation**: Add context cancellation section to contracts/executor-plugin.md:
```markdown
### Context Cancellation During Apply()

When Apply() is cancelled via context:
- Plugin SHOULD stop work immediately
- Plugin SHOULD NOT attempt rollback (leave system in known partial state)
- Plugin MUST return context.Canceled or context.DeadlineExceeded error
- Executor will log partial completion with warning
- User responsible for retry or manual cleanup
```

---

### G1: Migration Documentation Task Underspecified

**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM  
**Location**: spec.md:NFR-003, tasks.md:T034

**Problem**:
- NFR-003 requires "Documentation must clearly explain migration path"
- Task T034 mentions "Add migration guide for external plugin developers (if any)"
- No task for internal developer migration documentation
- No specification of what migration guide should contain

**Recommendation**: Split T034 into:
- T034a: Update docs/plugins.md with new interface examples
- T034b: Create docs/migration-guide.md for internal developers explaining before/after patterns

---

## Low Severity Findings (Nice to Have)

### T1: Terminology Inconsistency

**Severity**: üü¢ LOW  
**Location**: Multiple files

**Problem**: Mixed usage of "Plugin System" (spec title) vs "Plugin Interface" (requirements) vs "Interface Refactoring" (tasks).

**Recommendation**: Standardize on "Plugin Interface" throughout all documents.

---

### A4: InternalData Nil Handling Convention Unclear

**Severity**: üü¢ LOW  
**Location**: data-model.md:L108, contracts/plugin-interface.md:L143-148

**Problem**: Contract says Apply() "Should use InternalData" and "Should fall back if nil" but doesn't clarify if nil is normal or error condition.

**Recommendation**: Add note: "InternalData=nil is normal (plugin chose not to pass data); Apply() must handle gracefully"

---

### U3: Contract Test Execution Frequency Undefined

**Severity**: üü¢ LOW  
**Location**: tasks.md:T010, contracts/plugin-interface.md:L225-262

**Problem**: Contract test suite created in T010, run per-plugin in T017-T031, but no specification of CI integration or regression testing.

**Recommendation**: Add note to T010: "Contract tests run as part of standard `go test ./...` and will be enforced in CI"

---

## Coverage Analysis

### Requirements Coverage

**Fully Covered** (13/20 = 65%):
- FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008, FR-009, FR-010, FR-012, FR-014, FR-015, FR-016

**Partially Covered** (7/20 = 35%):
- FR-005: Eliminates old methods but doesn't review Metadata() duplication
- FR-011: Implicitly enforced by contract tests but no explicit task
- FR-013: Contract tests check but no enforcement mechanism defined
- NFR-001, NFR-002: Outcome-based, not directly measured
- NFR-003: Incomplete migration documentation task
- NFR-004: Implicit in contract tests

**No Coverage** (0/20 = 0%):
- All requirements have at least partial task coverage ‚úÖ

### Task Completeness

**Total Tasks**: 36  
**Unmapped Tasks**: 0 (all tasks trace to requirements or design documents)  
**Well-Specified**: 34/36 (94%)  
**Need Clarification**: 2/36 (T028-T031 command plugins, T034 documentation)

## Constitution Alignment

### Principle Assessment

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Onboarding First | ‚úÖ PASS | No new dependencies |
| II. Schema Clarity | ‚úÖ PASS | Structured errors improve clarity |
| III. Plugin Architecture | ‚ùå **VIOLATION** | See C1 - backward compatibility |
| IV. Safety by Default | ‚úÖ PASS | Read-only Evaluate() enhances safety |
| V. Performance & Reliability | ‚úÖ PASS | 20% overhead explicitly budgeted |
| VI. Extensibility | ‚úÖ PASS | Breaking change at API level only |
| VII. Ecosystem Consistency | ‚úÖ PASS | Improves consistency across plugins |

**Critical Issue**: Principle III violation (C1) must be resolved before proceeding.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Implementation)

1. **Review remediation proposals**: See `analysis/remediation-proposals.md`
2. **Approve/modify/reject** each proposal
3. **Apply approved changes** to specification documents
4. **Re-run gap analysis** (optional) to verify all issues resolved

### Before Task Execution

5. **Update AGENTS.md** with analysis findings and resolutions
6. **Brief implementation team** on clarified requirements
7. **Begin Phase 3** (task execution) with confidence

### During Implementation

8. **Reference this analysis** when questions arise about requirements
9. **Update this document** if new gaps discovered during implementation
10. **Mark findings as resolved** as issues are addressed

---

## Conclusion

The specification is **comprehensive and well-structured** but requires resolution of **1 critical constitutional issue** and clarification of **3 high-priority ambiguities** before implementation can safely proceed.

Estimated effort to resolve all high-priority issues: **2-3 hours**

All issues have concrete, actionable remediation proposals ready for review in `remediation-proposals.md`.

**Status**: üü° **READY FOR REMEDIATION** ‚Üí Once approved changes are applied, specification will be implementation-ready.
