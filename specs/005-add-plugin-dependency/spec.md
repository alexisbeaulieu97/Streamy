## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
5. **Constitution alignment**: Consider onboarding impact, schema clarity, safety defaults
   - Will this require external dependencies? (Principle I)
   - Is the configuration intuitive? (Principle II)
   - Are destructive operations identified and guarded? (Principle IV)
   - Are performance expectations clear? (Principle V)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Version Constraint Syntax - Which version constraint syntax should the system support? ‚Üí A: Major version matching (`1.x`) - allows minor/patch updates only
- Q: Plugin Instance State Isolation - Should dependency plugin state be isolated per dependent or shared? ‚Üí A: Configurable via metadata - shared singleton by default (stateless-by-contract), with optional per-dependent isolation for declared stateful plugins
- Q: Dependency Validation Failure Behavior - What happens when dependency validation fails? ‚Üí A: Configurable via settings.dependency_policy - defaults to graceful (skip affected plugins) for CLI/TUI, strict (abort execution) for automation/CI
- Q: Runtime Undeclared Dependency Access - How should undeclared dependency access be enforced? ‚Üí A: Environment-aware enforcement - strict (fail on access) for CI/automation, warn (log and continue) for CLI/interactive/debug, optional off mode for internal testing
- Q: Backward Compatibility for Existing Plugins - Should existing plugins without dependency metadata continue to work? ‚Üí A: Graceful migration - existing plugins work without modification, missing metadata treated as no dependencies with warning logged, strict requirement deferred to next major release

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A plugin developer wants to create a `shell_profile` plugin that manages shell configuration files. Instead of reimplementing line-in-file logic, they want to reuse the existing `line_in_file` plugin as a dependency. The system must allow the plugin to discover, declare, and safely use the `line_in_file` plugin's functionality while preventing circular dependencies and ensuring version compatibility.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a plugin declares a dependency on another registered plugin, **When** the plugin is initialized, **Then** the system resolves the dependency and provides access to the dependent plugin's functionality.

2. **Given** a plugin declares a dependency on a non-existent plugin, **When** the system initializes, **Then** the system reports a missing dependency error and prevents the plugin from loading.

3. **Given** two plugins declare circular dependencies on each other, **When** the system initializes, **Then** the system detects the cycle and reports an error preventing both plugins from loading.

4. **Given** a plugin declares a dependency with version constraints, **When** the system resolves dependencies, **Then** the system verifies version compatibility and loads only compatible versions.

5. **Given** a plugin successfully resolves its dependencies, **When** the plugin executes its apply or verify operation, **Then** the plugin can invoke the dependent plugin's operations and receive correct results.

6. **Given** multiple plugins depend on the same base plugin, **When** all plugins are loaded, **Then** the system shares a single instance of the base plugin across all dependents.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a plugin's dependency declares its own dependencies (transitive dependencies)?
  ‚Üí System must resolve the entire dependency chain and validate all transitive dependencies.

- What happens when two plugins require incompatible versions of the same dependency?
  ‚Üí System must detect the version conflict and report an error identifying which plugins have conflicting requirements.

- How does the system handle plugins that are registered after dependent plugins attempt to resolve them?
  ‚Üí System must validate all dependencies are registered before allowing any plugin to complete initialization.

- What happens when a plugin attempts to use a dependency at runtime that wasn't declared in its metadata?
  ‚Üí System should prevent undeclared runtime dependencies or log warnings about undeclared usage.

- How does the system handle dependency resolution order for complex graphs?
  ‚Üí System must use topological sorting to ensure dependencies are initialized before dependents.


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a centralized registry where all plugins can be registered with unique identifiers.

- **FR-002**: System MUST allow plugins to declare dependencies on other plugins through metadata. For backward compatibility, plugins without dependency metadata MUST continue to function (treated as having no dependencies), with a warning logged during initialization. Strict metadata requirements may be enforced in a future major release.

- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that all declared dependencies exist in the registry before plugin initialization completes. Validation failure behavior MUST be configurable via `RegistryConfig.DependencyPolicy` with environment-aware defaults: graceful mode (skip affected plugins, continue with valid ones) for interactive CLI/TUI contexts, and strict mode (abort entire execution) for automation/CI contexts.

- **FR-004**: System MUST detect circular dependencies between plugins and prevent their registration. Behavior follows the configurable `RegistryConfig.DependencyPolicy`: graceful mode skips circular dependency groups while allowing other plugins to load; strict mode aborts execution entirely.

- **FR-005**: System MUST support major version matching constraints (e.g., `1.x`, `2.x`) for plugin dependencies, allowing minor and patch updates within the same major version while preventing breaking changes across major version boundaries.

- **FR-006**: System MUST resolve transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) automatically.

- **FR-007**: System MUST provide plugins with safe access to their declared dependencies during apply and verify operations.

- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce that plugins only access dependencies explicitly declared in their metadata. Enforcement level varies by environment: strict mode (return error on undeclared access) for CI/automation contexts, warn mode (log warning but allow access) for CLI/interactive/debug contexts, with optional off mode for internal testing. The core invariant is that plugins may only interact with declared dependencies.

- **FR-009**: System MUST detect version conflicts when multiple plugins depend on incompatible versions of the same plugin. Conflict resolution follows `RegistryConfig.DependencyPolicy`: graceful mode disables conflicting dependents while preserving the dependency; strict mode aborts execution with detailed conflict report.

- **FR-010**: System MUST initialize plugins in dependency order, ensuring dependencies are ready before dependents.

- **FR-011**: System MUST share single instances of plugins across multiple dependents by default (assuming stateless-by-contract behavior). Plugins that maintain internal state MUST be able to declare a stateful isolation preference in their metadata, triggering per-dependent instance creation to prevent unsafe state sharing.

- **FR-012**: System MUST report clear error messages identifying missing, circular, or incompatible dependencies. Error messages must include context, cause, and remediation suggestion.

- **FR-013**: System MUST allow plugins to reuse other plugins' apply operations to compose higher-level functionality.

- **FR-014**: System MUST allow plugins to reuse other plugins' verify operations to ensure consistent validation.

- **FR-015**: System MUST propagate errors from dependent plugins back to the calling plugin with proper context.

- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing plugins that lack dependency metadata, treating them as having zero dependencies and logging a deprecation warning. This allows graceful migration without breaking existing plugin installations.

### Key Entities

- **PluginRegistry**: Central repository that maintains all registered plugins, provides lookup by unique identifier, manages initialization order, and validates dependency graphs. Contains version information for each plugin and tracks registration state.

- **PluginMetadata**: Descriptive information about a plugin including its unique name/identifier, semantic version, list of declared dependencies (with optional version constraints), human-readable description, and Stateful field. Plugins that maintain internal state can set Stateful to true to receive per-dependent instances instead of shared singletons. Used for validation and dependency resolution.

- **DependencyGraph**: Representation of relationships between plugins, used to detect circular dependencies, determine initialization order through topological sorting, and identify transitive dependencies. Validated during plugin registration.

- **VersionConstraint**: Specification of acceptable version ranges for dependencies using major version matching syntax (e.g., `1.x`, `2.x`). Allows minor and patch version updates within the same major version while preventing breaking changes across major versions. Used to validate compatibility between dependent and dependency plugins.

## Constitution Alignment Notes

**Principle I (Minimal External Dependencies)**: The dependency registry is an internal Streamy capability that allows plugins to depend on other plugins within the ecosystem, not external systems. This maintains the zero-dependency philosophy while enabling composability.

**Principle II (Configuration Clarity)**: Plugin dependency declarations must be explicit and visible in plugin metadata, making the dependency graph transparent and auditable. Users can understand which plugins depend on others.

**Principle IV (Safety by Default)**: The system validates dependency graphs before execution, preventing circular dependencies and missing dependencies that could lead to runtime failures. This ensures safe composition.

**Principle V (Performance Awareness)**: Shared plugin instances across dependents avoid duplication and reduce initialization overhead. Dependency resolution happens once at startup, not during execution.
