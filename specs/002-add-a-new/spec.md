## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Streamy user configuring team onboarding, I need to render configuration files from templates with team-specific or environment-specific variables, so that I can maintain a single template source while generating customized files for different contexts (e.g., different developers, environments, or projects).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a template file exists at `/templates/config.tmpl` with variable placeholders, and I define inline variables in my Streamy step, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** a rendered file is created at the specified destination with all variables substituted from the inline variables.

2. **Given** a template file exists with variable placeholders, and some variables are defined as environment variables, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the rendered file contains values from environment variables where inline variables are not provided.

3. **Given** a template file exists and a rendered destination file already exists with identical content to what would be rendered, **When** Streamy executes the template step in Check mode, **Then** the step reports as already satisfied (idempotent skip).

4. **Given** a template file exists and a rendered destination file already exists with different content, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the existing file is overwritten with newly rendered content.

5. **Given** a template file references a variable that is not defined in inline vars or environment variables, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the step fails with a clear error message indicating which variable is missing.

6. **Given** the destination directory does not exist, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the system creates necessary parent directories before writing the rendered file.

7. **Given** I run Streamy in dry-run mode with a template step, **When** the template step is processed, **Then** the system reports what would be rendered without actually creating or modifying files.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the template source file does not exist?
  ‚Üí Step fails with clear error indicating the missing source file path.

- What happens when the user lacks write permissions to the destination path?
  ‚Üí Step fails with clear error indicating permission denied and the destination path.

- What happens when a variable value contains special characters or multi-line content?
  ‚Üí System renders the variable value exactly as provided, preserving special characters and newlines.

- What happens when the destination file exists but is a directory instead of a file?
  ‚Üí Step fails with clear error indicating type mismatch.

- What happens when inline variables and environment variables both define the same variable?
  ‚Üí Inline variables take precedence over environment variables (explicit over implicit).

- What happens when the template file is empty?
  ‚Üí System creates an empty destination file (valid use case).

- What happens when the rendered output would be identical to the template source (no variables to substitute)?
  ‚Üí System creates the destination file with identical content (valid use case).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a template source file path as input for the template step.

- **FR-002**: System MUST accept a destination file path where the rendered output will be written.

- **FR-003**: System MUST accept an optional inline variables map (key-value pairs) for variable substitution.

- **FR-004**: System MUST substitute variables in the template with values from inline variables when provided.

- **FR-005**: System MUST substitute variables in the template with values from environment variables when not provided in inline variables.

- **FR-006**: System MUST give precedence to inline variables over environment variables for the same variable name.

- **FR-007**: System MUST fail with a descriptive error when a template references a variable that is undefined in both inline vars and environment variables.

- **FR-008**: System MUST read the template source file and render output to the destination file path.

- **FR-009**: System MUST create parent directories for the destination file if they do not exist.

- **FR-010**: System MUST support idempotent execution by comparing the rendered output content with existing destination file content before writing.

- **FR-011**: System MUST skip writing the destination file when the rendered content matches the existing file content (idempotency check passes).

- **FR-012**: System MUST overwrite the destination file when the rendered content differs from existing content.

- **FR-013**: System MUST report clear error messages when the source template file does not exist.

- **FR-014**: System MUST report clear error messages when write permissions are denied for the destination path.

- **FR-015**: System MUST support dry-run mode by previewing what would be rendered without modifying files.

- **FR-016**: System MUST preserve the template source file unchanged (read-only operation on source).

- **FR-017**: System MUST handle multi-line variable values and special characters in variable values without corruption.

- **FR-018**: System MUST validate that the destination path is not a directory when a file is expected.

- **FR-019**: System MUST handle empty template files as valid input (rendering to empty output file).

- **FR-020**: System MUST support a defined template syntax format for variable placeholders within template files. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific template syntax not specified - Go templates, Mustache, simple ${VAR}, or other format?]

- **FR-021**: System MUST handle template syntax errors gracefully with clear error messages indicating the issue and location in the template. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error handling severity and detail level for malformed templates]

- **FR-022**: System MUST preserve or set file permissions on the rendered destination file. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file permission behavior not specified - copy from template source, use default umask, or allow explicit configuration?]

### Key Entities

- **Template Step Configuration**: Represents a single template rendering operation defined in a Streamy configuration file. Contains source template path, destination file path, optional inline variables map, and standard step metadata (ID, description, dependencies).

- **Template Source File**: An existing file containing static content with variable placeholders following a defined syntax. Remains unchanged during execution.

- **Rendered Destination File**: The output file created by substituting variables in the template with actual values. May be newly created or overwritten based on idempotency check.

- **Variable**: A named placeholder in a template that gets replaced with an actual value. Can be sourced from inline step configuration or environment variables, with inline taking precedence.

## Clarifications Needed Before Implementation

1. **Template Syntax**: Which template syntax should be used for variable placeholders? Options include Go text/template syntax, simple shell-style `${VAR}` or `$VAR`, Mustache/Handlebars `{{VAR}}`, or other formats. Recommendation: Go text/template for consistency with Go ecosystem, but `${VAR}` for simplicity in MVP.

2. **File Permissions**: How should file permissions be handled for rendered files? Options include: (a) use system default umask, (b) copy permissions from template source file, or (c) allow explicit permission configuration in step. Recommendation: Copy from source by default with optional explicit permission field.

3. **Template Error Handling**: What level of detail should be provided when template syntax is malformed? Should execution continue with warnings or fail fast? Recommendation: Fail fast with clear error messages showing line/column of syntax errors for rapid debugging.
