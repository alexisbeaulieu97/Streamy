## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Streamy user configuring team onboarding, I need to render configuration files from templates with team-specific or environment-specific variables, so that I can maintain a single template source while generating customized files for different contexts (e.g., different developers, environments, or projects).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a template file exists at `/templates/config.tmpl` with variable placeholders, and I define inline variables in my Streamy step, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** a rendered file is created at the specified destination with all variables substituted from the inline variables.

2. **Given** a template file exists with variable placeholders, and some variables are defined as environment variables, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the rendered file contains values from environment variables where inline variables are not provided.

3. **Given** a template file exists and a rendered destination file already exists with identical content to what would be rendered, **When** Streamy executes the template step in Check mode, **Then** the step reports as already satisfied (idempotent skip).

4. **Given** a template file exists and a rendered destination file already exists with different content, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the existing file is overwritten with newly rendered content.

5. **Given** a template file references a variable that is not defined in inline vars or environment variables, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the step fails with a clear error message indicating which variable is missing.

5a. **Given** a user provides an inline variable with an invalid name (violating Go identifier rules), **When** Streamy validates the configuration, **Then** the validation fails with a clear error message indicating the invalid variable name.

6. **Given** the destination directory does not exist, **When** Streamy executes the template step, **Then** the system creates necessary parent directories before writing the rendered file.

7. **Given** I run Streamy in dry-run mode with a template step, **When** the template step is processed, **Then** the system reports what would be rendered without actually creating or modifying files.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the template source file does not exist?
  ‚Üí Step fails with clear error indicating the missing source file path.

- What happens when the user lacks write permissions to the destination path?
  ‚Üí Step fails with clear error indicating permission denied and the destination path.

- What happens when a variable value contains special characters or multi-line content?
  ‚Üí System renders the variable value exactly as provided, preserving special characters and newlines.

- What happens when the destination file exists but is a directory instead of a file?
  ‚Üí Step fails with clear error indicating type mismatch.

- What happens when inline variables and environment variables both define the same variable?
  ‚Üí Inline variables take precedence over environment variables (explicit over implicit).

- What happens when the template file is empty?
  ‚Üí System creates an empty destination file (valid use case).

- What happens when the rendered output would be identical to the template source (no variables to substitute)?
  ‚Üí System creates the destination file with identical content (valid use case).

- What happens when the template contains syntax errors (malformed Go template)?
  ‚Üí Step fails immediately with error message showing line/column location of the syntax error.

- What happens when a variable name in inline vars violates Go identifier rules?
  ‚Üí Configuration validation fails with clear error indicating the invalid variable name.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a template source file path as input for the template step.

- **FR-002**: System MUST accept a destination file path where the rendered output will be written.

- **FR-003**: System MUST accept an optional inline variables map (key-value pairs) for variable substitution.

- **FR-003a**: System MUST accept an optional file mode/permission specification for the rendered destination file (e.g., octal notation like 0644).

- **FR-004**: System MUST substitute variables in the template with values from inline variables when provided.

- **FR-005**: System MUST substitute variables in the template with values from environment variables when not provided in inline variables.

- **FR-006**: System MUST give precedence to inline variables over environment variables for the same variable name.

- **FR-007**: System MUST fail with a descriptive error when a template references a variable that is undefined in both inline vars and environment variables.

- **FR-008**: System MUST read the template source file and render output to the destination file path.

- **FR-009**: System MUST create parent directories for the destination file if they do not exist.

- **FR-010**: System MUST support idempotent execution by comparing the rendered output content with existing destination file content before writing.

- **FR-011**: System MUST skip writing the destination file when the rendered content matches the existing file content (idempotency check passes).

- **FR-012**: System MUST overwrite the destination file when the rendered content differs from existing content.

- **FR-013**: System MUST report clear error messages when the source template file does not exist.

- **FR-014**: System MUST report clear error messages when write permissions are denied for the destination path.

- **FR-015**: System MUST support dry-run mode by previewing what would be rendered without modifying files.

- **FR-016**: System MUST preserve the template source file unchanged (read-only operation on source).

- **FR-017**: System MUST handle multi-line variable values and special characters in variable values without corruption.

- **FR-018**: System MUST validate that the destination path is not a directory when a file is expected.

- **FR-019**: System MUST handle empty template files as valid input (rendering to empty output file).

- **FR-020**: System MUST support Go text/template syntax format for variable placeholders within template files (e.g., `{{.VAR}}` for simple variables, with support for conditionals and loops).

- **FR-021**: System MUST fail execution immediately when template syntax is malformed, providing an error message that includes the specific issue and the line/column location in the template file.

- **FR-022**: System MUST set file permissions on the rendered destination file by copying from the template source file when no explicit permission is specified.

- **FR-023**: System MUST override default permissions and apply the explicitly specified file mode when provided in the step configuration.

- **FR-024**: System MUST log minimal output during template rendering operations, reporting only success or failure status to maintain clean, production-friendly logs.

- **FR-025**: System MUST validate that variable names in inline variables follow Go identifier rules (start with letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores).

### Key Entities

- **Template Step Configuration**: Represents a single template rendering operation defined in a Streamy configuration file. Contains source template path, destination file path, optional inline variables map, optional file mode/permission specification, and standard step metadata (ID, description, dependencies).

- **Template Source File**: An existing file containing static content with variable placeholders following Go text/template syntax (e.g., `{{.VariableName}}`). Remains unchanged during execution.

- **Rendered Destination File**: The output file created by substituting variables in the template with actual values. May be newly created or overwritten based on idempotency check.

- **Variable**: A named placeholder in a template that gets replaced with an actual value. Can be sourced from inline step configuration or environment variables, with inline taking precedence. Variable names must follow Go identifier rules (start with letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: Which template syntax format should be used for variable placeholders? ‚Üí A: Go text/template `{{.VAR}}` - Go ecosystem standard, supports conditionals and loops, more powerful
- Q: How should file permissions be handled for rendered destination files? ‚Üí A: Allow explicit permission configuration in step (e.g., `mode: 0644`) with source file as fallback
- Q: How should template syntax errors be handled when the template is malformed? ‚Üí A: Fail fast with error showing line/column - stops execution immediately, precise debugging
- Q: What information should be logged during template rendering operations? ‚Üí A: Minimal: success/failure status only - least verbose, production-friendly
- Q: Should variable names in templates have any naming constraints or validation rules? ‚Üí A: Follow Go identifier rules - consistent with Go text/template conventions
