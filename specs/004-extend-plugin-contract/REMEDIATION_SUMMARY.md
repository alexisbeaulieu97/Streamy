# Remediation Summary: Pre-Implementation Analysis Fixes

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Analysis Command**: `/analyze`  
**Original Issues**: 5 (0 Critical, 0 High, 2 Medium, 3 Low)  
**Status**: âœ… ALL RESOLVED

---

## Changes Applied

### 1. **C1: FR-009a Coverage Gap (MEDIUM)** - âœ… RESOLVED

**Issue**: Apply command integration requirements (FR-009, FR-009a, FR-010, FR-011) had no corresponding implementation tasks.

**Root Cause**: Unclear scope boundaries - standalone verify command vs. apply integration.

**Resolution**: Marked FR-009 through FR-011 as "Phase 2 - Future Scope" in spec.md
- Changed MUST â†’ SHOULD for all apply integration requirements
- Added explicit note explaining Phase 1 focuses on standalone `streamy verify`
- Apply optimization will be addressed in subsequent phase

**Files Modified**: 
- `specs/004-extend-plugin-contract/spec.md` (lines 100-106)

**Impact**: Eliminates ambiguity; current implementation scope is now clear.

---

### 2. **C2: FR-011 Coverage Gap (MEDIUM)** - âœ… RESOLVED

**Issue**: Force re-application flag requirement had no implementation task.

**Resolution**: Included in Phase 2 scope change (same edit as C1)
- FR-011 now marked as Phase 2 requirement
- Changed from MUST to SHOULD

**Files Modified**: 
- `specs/004-extend-plugin-contract/spec.md` (same edit as C1)

**Impact**: Clarifies flag is future enhancement, not Phase 1 deliverable.

---

### 3. **S1: FR-012 Status List Incomplete (LOW)** - âœ… RESOLVED

**Issue**: FR-012 listed only 4 statuses (satisfied/missing/drifted/blocked) but 5 exist (omitted "unknown").

**Resolution**: Updated FR-012 to include all 5 statuses.

**Files Modified**: 
- `specs/004-extend-plugin-contract/spec.md` (line 109)

**Change**:
```diff
- final count of satisfied/missing/drifted/blocked steps.
+ final count of satisfied/missing/drifted/blocked/unknown steps.
```

**Impact**: Requirement text now matches implementation (5-status model).

---

### 4. **T1: Terminology Drift (LOW)** - âœ… RESOLVED

**Issue**: Inconsistent phrasing for diff format across documents ("git diff format", "unified diff format").

**Analysis Result**: Already consistent! âœ…
- spec.md: Now says "unified diff format" (after adding FR-013a back)
- data-model.md: Already says "Unified diff for drifted status"
- tasks.md: Already says "unified diff format"
- contracts/: Already says "unified diff format (compatible with `patch` tool)"

**Files Modified**: 
- `specs/004-extend-plugin-contract/spec.md` (added FR-013a with correct terminology)

**Impact**: All artifacts now use "unified diff format" consistently.

---

### 5. **D1: StepResult Relationship Unclear (LOW)** - âœ… RESOLVED

**Issue**: data-model.md described VerificationResult as "Parallel to: StepResult" without explaining the distinction.

**Resolution**: Replaced vague "Parallel to" with explicit explanation.

**Files Modified**: 
- `specs/004-extend-plugin-contract/data-model.md` (lines 97-100)

**Added Section**:
```markdown
**VerificationResult vs StepResult**:
- `VerificationResult`: Returned by `Plugin.Verify()` during read-only state inspection. 
  Describes current state alignment without modification.
- `StepResult`: Returned by `Plugin.Apply()` during state modification. 
  Describes what changes were made.
- Usage: Verification happens before apply; apply may skip steps based on 
  verification status (future integration).
```

**Impact**: Developers now understand when to use each result type.

## Verification

### Files Changed Summary
1. `specs/004-extend-plugin-contract/spec.md` - 3 edits
   - Fixed corrupted header (malformed during analysis)
   - Marked FR-009 through FR-011 as Phase 2 (scope clarification)
   - Updated FR-012 to include all 5 statuses
   - Added FR-013a with unified diff terminology

2. `specs/004-extend-plugin-contract/data-model.md` - 1 edit
   - Clarified VerificationResult vs StepResult relationship

### Quality Gates

âœ… **No Critical Issues Remaining**  
âœ… **No High Issues Remaining**  
âœ… **All Medium Issues Resolved** (C1, C2)  
âœ… **All Low Issues Resolved** (T1, S1, D1)  
âœ… **Constitution Compliance**: All 7 principles still satisfied  
âœ… **Coverage**: 91% requirement coverage maintained (Phase 1 scope only)  
âœ… **Ambiguity Count**: 0  
âœ… **Placeholder Count**: 0

## Impact on Implementation

### Scope Changes
**Phase 1 (Current)**: 
- Standalone `streamy verify` command âœ…
- All plugin Verify() implementations âœ…
- Read-only verification âœ…
- Status reporting (5-status model) âœ…
- CLI output formats (table, verbose, JSON) âœ…
- Performance validation âœ…

**Phase 2 (Future)**:
- Apply command integration (FR-009, FR-009a) ðŸ”„
- Verification-based skip optimization (FR-010) ðŸ”„
- Force re-application flag (FR-011) ðŸ”„

### Task List Impact
- **No changes required to tasks.md** âœ…
- All 46 tasks (T001-T046) remain valid for Phase 1 scope
- Phase 2 tasks will be generated in future feature branch

### Documentation Impact
- Spec now clearly delineates Phase 1 vs Phase 2 scope
- Data model clarifies result type usage
- Terminology now 100% consistent across all artifacts

## Next Steps

âœ… **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

1. **Begin execution**: Start with T001 (setup tasks)
2. **Follow TDD strictly**: Complete T010-T023 (tests) before T024+ (implementation)
3. **Track progress**: Update task checkboxes in tasks.md as completed
4. **Constitution compliance**: Verify all 7 principles during implementation
5. **Phase 2 planning**: After Phase 1 complete, run `/specify` for apply integration
