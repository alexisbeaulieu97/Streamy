# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Dashboard for Pipeline Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 8, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Complete**: All checklist items pass âœ“

**Implementation details note**: The Dependencies and Assumptions sections appropriately reference existing codebase components (e.g., `internal/tui/`, Bubble Tea framework) as context, which is acceptable for those sections. The core specification (Requirements, Success Criteria, User Stories) remains technology-agnostic and focused on user value.

**Clarifications resolved**: 
- Q1: Verification cancellation behavior - Resolved with Option C (confirmation dialog)

**Next steps**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
