## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: Which operating systems must Streamy MVP support? ‚Üí A: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows native)
- Q: Which package managers must the MVP `package` step type support? ‚Üí A: Single: apt only (Ubuntu/Debian). Later, a "smart" plugin will be provided which calls different package manager plugins
- Q: What should happen when a step fails during execution? ‚Üí A: Always halt immediately (fail-fast)
- Q: How should Streamy handle parallel execution limits? ‚Üí A: User configurable with sensible default
- Q: What logging output format should Streamy support? ‚Üí A: Human-readable text only for MVP (TUI)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A developer receives a new laptop and needs to set up their development environment. Instead of following a lengthy manual setup guide with dozens of commands, they download a single binary (Streamy) and run it with their team's environment config file. Streamy reads the YAML config, validates it, shows a preview of what will happen (dry-run), and then executes all setup steps in the correct order. When finished, the developer has all tools installed, repos cloned, config files in place, and their environment validated‚Äîall from one command.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid YAML config file with package installations, **When** user runs `streamy apply config.yaml`, **Then** Streamy installs all specified packages and reports success for each

2. **Given** a config with dependent steps (repo clone depends on git being installed), **When** Streamy executes the config, **Then** git is installed first, then the repo is cloned

3. **Given** a config with independent steps (two repo clones), **When** Streamy executes them, **Then** both clones can happen in parallel for faster execution

4. **Given** any valid config, **When** user runs `streamy apply config.yaml --dry-run`, **Then** Streamy shows what would happen without making any changes

5. **Given** a config with validations, **When** all steps complete, **Then** Streamy runs validation checks and reports whether the environment is correctly set up

6. **Given** a config with a step that fails, **When** execution encounters the error, **Then** Streamy stops execution, logs the error clearly, and indicates which step failed

7. **Given** a config file with schema errors, **When** Streamy parses it, **Then** validation fails before any execution with clear error messages indicating what's wrong

8. **Given** a step that is already complete (idempotent), **When** Streamy runs the config again, **Then** that step is skipped with a "already satisfied" message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a YAML file is malformed or has invalid syntax?
  - Streamy must detect this during parsing and show clear error messages before attempting execution.

- What happens when a dependency cycle exists (step A depends on B, B depends on A)?
  - Streamy must detect cycles during DAG construction and refuse to execute with a clear error.

- What happens when a step fails partway through execution?
  - Streamy must halt execution, log the error with context, and indicate which steps succeeded and which failed.

- What happens when a validation fails after all steps complete?
  - Streamy must report validation failures clearly, indicating which checks passed and which failed.

- What happens when a user cancels execution mid-run (Ctrl+C)?
  - Streamy should handle graceful shutdown, indicating which steps completed and which were interrupted.

- What happens when running the same config multiple times?
  - Streamy's steps should be idempotent where possible (skip already-installed packages, don't re-clone existing repos, etc.).

- What happens when a file path doesn't exist for symlink or copy operations?
  - Streamy must validate paths and report clear errors before attempting operations.

## Sample Test Configuration

For validation and testing purposes, a sample configuration should demonstrate all MVP capabilities:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
name: "Developer Environment Setup"
description: "Full development environment for new team members"
  
steps:
  - id: install_git
    name: "Install Git"
    type: package
    packages:
      - git
      
  - id: install_curl
    name: "Install curl"
    type: package
    packages:
      - curl
      
  - id: clone_dotfiles
    name: "Clone dotfiles repository"
    type: repo
    depends_on:
      - install_git
    url: "https://github.com/example/dotfiles.git"
    destination: "~/.dotfiles"
    
  - id: link_vimrc
    name: "Symlink vimrc"
    type: symlink
    depends_on:
      - clone_dotfiles
    source: "~/.dotfiles/vimrc"
    target: "~/.vimrc"
    
  - id: add_path_export
    name: "Add custom PATH to shell config"
    type: command
    command: 'echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/bin" >> ~/.bashrc'
    check: 'grep "export PATH.*~/bin" ~/.bashrc'
    
validations:
  - type: command_exists
    command: git
    
  - type: command_exists
    command: curl
    
  - type: file_exists
    path: "~/.vimrc"
    
  - type: path_contains
    file: "~/.bashrc"
    text: "export PATH.*~/bin"
```

This configuration demonstrates:
- Multiple package installations (can run in parallel)
- Dependency ordering (git before repo clone)
- All five step types
- Idempotency checking (command with check)
- Post-execution validations
